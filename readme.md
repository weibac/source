This is the start of source. 

I intend it to be a compendium of true spiritual texts. I am not infallible, and thus I cannot provide guarantees of actual truth. However, I vow to strive to make it less wrong than any other existing spiritual anthology. I will include profuse markers of epistemic status, and never write under my own voice anything I know to be false. I write from an empiricist, materialist, pragmatic background. I am an atheist. Belief in God is an epistemic error, and sometimes even a source of spiritual error. I hold that correct epistemics greatly enrich spiritual belief and practice.

*Spiritual* is used and understood here in an extremely broad sense. It encompasses the *awesome* in both its original and contemporary usages. Subjects will likely include epistemology, ethics, and (critical, skeptical) comparative religion. Some texts to be included in this volume have already been written by other authors. Some I will write myself. Some I will write factually and literally, some will be metaphorical and lyrical in nature. This distinction will be clearly marked for each case.

As a closing remark, some words on the naming of this project: cause, origin, informant, primary source, source code, wellspring.
