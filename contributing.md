I consider this project to be a potentially collaborative yet ultimately individual effort. I will strive to find truth, and yet I recognize that others may disagree with my conclusions. Furthermore, no best guess at truth is to be mistaken for the actual truth. I encourage the reader to also strive to find the truth, and to document their efforts and findings.

Feel free to fork. I reserve the right to steal some or all of your fork's commits.

Feel free to make pull requests. However, I will merge into main only contributions I find to be relevant and true or useful. I will strive to hold strict epistemic standards for all content, regardless of committer.
